# CP1404 Practical Repository

## This is a repository for Matthew Jackson's weekly practicals that are required for CP1404.

### Clean code lessons:

- Use proper naming conventions for variables, constants, functions, lists, dictionaries and classes. This allows anyone else looking
  at your code to easily identify what things are by looking at the convention used.
- Use constants where applicable to avoid cases of magic numbers which don't give any additional clarification when used.
- Use comments in a meaningful fashion. Don't overload your file with comments for the sake of requiring comments.
Use comments to remind yourself or other readers of how or why something was done.
